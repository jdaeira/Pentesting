copy the key into a file and then use the following command:

#### Bandit Level 17 → Level 18
```
used the command below to get the password:
diff passwords.new passwords.old
password: kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd

### Bandit Level 18 → Level 19
```
command to get to the next password:

password: IueksS7Ubh8G3DCwVzrTd8rAVOwq3M5x
```

### Bandit Level 19 → Level 20
```
$ ./bandit20-do
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id
So the bandit20-do program will run whatever command we specify (as an argument, it looks like) as another user (in this case, the bandit20 user).
Let's try that example they give us:
$ ./bandit20-do id
uid=11019(bandit19) gid=11019(bandit19) euid=11020(bandit20) groups=11020(bandit20),11019(bandit19)

Look closely at this output! Our uid, our user id is for bandit19, but our euid, or our effective user id is that of the bandit20 user. Because of the way the setuid binary works, we are effectively the bandit20 user whenever we run the program!
So let's try and run a different command, just to further drive the point home:
$ ./bandit20-do whoami
bandit20
password: GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
```

#### Bandit Level 20 → Level 21
```
need to setup a listener service to listen on any port, and then use the binary submit this level’s password to it.
Command to setup the port listener:
echo GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j | nc -l -p 60000
open a new command line and run: nmap localhost -p 60000 
to see if setup correctly
run: ./suconnect 60000
password: gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr
```

#### Bandit Level 21 → Level 22
```
Went to /etc/cron.d where the cron jobs are located.
did a “cat cat cronjob_bandit22” to see the code of the cronjob
did a “cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh” to see the code of the bash file
did a “cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv” to get the password
password: Yk7owGAcWjwMVRwrTesJEwB7WVOiILLI
```

#### Bandit Level 22 → Level 23
```
ran the bash script to the get the name of the directory with the password
directory name is: cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
password: jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5XIAI6i0n
```

#### Bandit Level 23 → Level 24
```
wrote the bandit23.sh script to get the new password:
#!/bin/bash

myname="bandit24"
echo $myname
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
echo $mytarget

Output was: ee4ee1703b083edac9f8183e4ae70293

then put the output of that to get the passowrd:
cat /tmp/ee4ee1703b083edac9f8183e4ae70293
password: UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ
```

#### Bandit Level 24 → Level 25
```
run the pincode.sh script and then the command below:
cat passlist.txt | nc localhost 30002
password: uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG

```

#### Bandit Level 26 → Level 27
```
Commands to get password:
./bandit27-do id
uid=11026(bandit26) gid=11026(bandit26) euid=11027(bandit27) groups=11026(bandit26)

euid shows that bandit26 has access to bandit27

./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
password: 3ba3118a22e93127a4ed485be72ef5ea
```

#### Bandit Level 27 → Level 28
```
Commands to get password:
created a folder /tmp/jdaeira3
git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo
cd into the folder with the README file
cat README
password: 0ef186ac70e04ea33b4c1853d2526fa2
```

#### Bandit Level 28 → Level 29
```
First we must do a "git log" command to see the different versions of the repo
We see there are 3 different versions of the repo 

git diff 186a1038cc54d1358d42d468cdc8e3cc28a93fcb 073c27c130e6ee407e12faad1dd3848a110c4f95
This command checks the difference between the 2 versions. The password is found.
password: bbc96594b4e001778eee9975372716b2
```

#### Bandit Level 29 → Level 30
```
Commands to get password:
git log
git show-branch --all
git checkout -b origin/dev
git remote show
git remote show origin
git checkout dev
cat README.md
password: 5b90576bedb2cc04c86a9e924ce42faf
```

#### Bandit Level 30 → Level 31
```
cat .git/packed-refs in repo directory
git show --name-only secret command gets the password
password: 47e603bb428404d265f59c42920d81e5
```

#### Bandit Level 31 → Level 32
```
cat README.md 
This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master

echo "May I come in? > key.txt
git add -f key.txt
git commit -m "added a text file"
git push
password: 56a9bf19c63d650ce78e6ec0354ee45e
```

#### Bandit Level 32 → Level 33
```
