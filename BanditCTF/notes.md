### Bandit Level 19 → Level 20
```
$ ./bandit20-do
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id
So the bandit20-do program will run whatever command we specify (as an argument, it looks like) as another user (in this case, the bandit20 user).
Let's try that example they give us:
$ ./bandit20-do id
uid=11019(bandit19) gid=11019(bandit19) euid=11020(bandit20) groups=11020(bandit20),11019(bandit19)

Look closely at this output! Our uid, our user id is for bandit19, but our euid, or our effective user id is that of the bandit20 user. Because of the way the setuid binary works, we are effectively the bandit20 user whenever we run the program!
So let's try and run a different command, just to further drive the point home:
$ ./bandit20-do whoami
bandit20
password: GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
```

#### Bandit Level 20 → Level 21
```
need to setup a listener service to listen on any port, and then use the binary submit this level’s password to it.
Command to setup the port listener:
echo GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j | nc -l -p 60000
open a new command line and run: nmap localhost -p 60000 
to see if setup correctly
run: ./suconnect 60000
password: gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr
```

#### Bandit Level 21 → Level 22
```
Went to /etc/cron.d where the cron jobs are located.
did a “cat cat cronjob_bandit22” to see the code of the cronjob
did a “cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh” to see the code of the bash file
did a “cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv” to get the password
password: Yk7owGAcWjwMVRwrTesJEwB7WVOiILLI
```

#### Bandit Level 22 → Level 23
```
ran the bash script to the get the name of the directory with the password
directory name is: cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
password: jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5XIAI6i0n
```

#### Bandit Level 23 → Level 24
```
wrote the following script to get the new password:
#!/bin/bash

myname="bandit24"
echo $myname
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
echo $mytarget

Output was: ee4ee1703b083edac9f8183e4ae70293

then put the output of that to get the passowrd:
cat /tmp/ee4ee1703b083edac9f8183e4ae70293
password: UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ
